# A Constructive Formalisation of Hoare Logic in Agda 
(My Master's Project at the University of Birimingham)

A constructive formalisation of Hoare logic and an Agda library 
that is fit for the purpose of proving correct simple imperative-style 
programs using a selection of implemented Hoare logic rules.


For an (admittedly underwhelming) example, this library allows for a
constructive proof of the correctness of a 'swap' program via the
following type/top-level definition:
